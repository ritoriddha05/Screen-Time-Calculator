A Screen-Time Calculator


Overview of the Project


This is my first independent assignment for the subject of CSE.

The project targets the issue of unmonitored screen time for college students. It's a simple tool for manually logging, data processing, and visualization that demonstrates core concepts including Object-Oriented Design and Modular Programming.


Functional Requirements: Three Major Modules

1. Data Input and Management:

Features to implement: recording new entries with duration, date, and category; full CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete; data should be persisted.

2. Processing and Calculation:

    Features: Calculate total daily/weekly screen time, determine total hours spent in each category, and classify time as Productive or Unproductive.

3. Reporting and Visualization:

    Features: Show weekly averages, highlight most time-consuming categories, enable filtering of data by date/category, and present the screen time breakdown clearly.


Non-Functional Requirements (Minimum Four)


1. Usability: An intuitive interface allows users to navigate it fast and enter information quickly.

2. Reliability: Data storage prevents the loss and corruption of logged entries.

3. Error Handling: Input validation rejects negative or non-numeric time values and displays clear error messages.

4. Performance: The system processes and displays reports fast, even for large datasets.


Technologies Used

1. Primary Language: [Insert Language, e.g., Python / Java / JavaScript]

2. User Interface: [Insert UI Method, e.g., Console / HTML/CSS]

3. Data Storage: [Insert Storage Method, e.g., JSON File / CSV File]

4. Version Control: Git & GitHub


Installation and Setup

1. Requirements: You must have installed [Software 1, e.g., Python 3.10+]

2. How to Run: Clone this repository and run the application with command: python main_app.py or equivalent.
