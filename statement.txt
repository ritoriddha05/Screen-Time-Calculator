Project Statement: Screen-Time Calculator

Problem Statement

Most college students are under increased pressure in the present academic environment to balance digital learning tools-such as online lectures and research-against distractions provided by social media and entertainment. This often leads to excessive, unmonitored screen time. This lack of self-awareness in regard to digital habits leads to reduced focus, poor time management, and possibly compromised academic performance. The problem this project addresses is the quantifiable gap between a student's perceived screen usage and their actual usage.

Project Scope

Digital Wellness Tracker is a single-user application designed to provide the user with a transparent, data-driven view into their digital habits.

System WILL:

1. Allow manual entry of screen time log: time spent, date, and category.

2. Perform all the Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on log entries.

3. Calculate daily, weekly, and total time spent across all defined categories.

4. Display data visually as simple text or graphical charts.

5. Persist data for the view and analysis of historical records by the user.

System WILL NOT:

1. Automatically track screen time with no background monitoring nor integration with device APIs.

2. Provide multi-user functionality, networking, or cloud syncing.

3. Send external notifications, reminders, or push alerts.

4. Use sophisticated functionality such as predictive modeling or machine learning algorithms.

Target Users

The target users are mainly first- and second-year university students, who want to enhance their personal time management and digital well-being. This tool is also intended for any person interested in a basic, manual logging solution for time tracking and analysis.

High-Level Features

1. Time Entry Module: A module with a user interface to log data rapidly and accurately, implementing validation.

2. Category management enables the classification of time spent, such as Study, Social, or Entertainment, for meaningful analysis.

3. Data Persistence: Secure saving and retrieval of historical log data.

4. Dashboard View: Centralized, filtered view that provides aggregated statistics and visualizes trends.
